# Choerodon-front-iam 

The project is an overall front-end project that combines Choerodon Boot and Choerodon iam. The infrastructure Choerodon-front-iam module in the Choerodon front can be added selectively. The construction project can be used on `macOS`, `Windows` or `Linux`. Teams can be developed in modules, greatly speeding up development.

 * The project uses `webpack` for construction.
 * Use `gulp` to manage related processes.
 * Use `yeoman` to automatically generate related modules for the project.
 * `React` and `Mobx` are used as the main development technology.

 * Project layout:
    * Project Settings

## Development build

The development is modeled on the i'm project structure (it is recommended that the directory structure is automatically generated by the yo command, saving the time for automatic directory creation). The source file directory is in `iam/src/app/iam`. The main directory structure is as follows:

    │   └── app
    │       └── iam
    │           ├── assets
